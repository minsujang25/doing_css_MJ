# 🗺️ Geospatial Data Processing and Visualization with Python

This repository contains materials for the graduate workshop taught by **Minsu Jang** at the **Behave Lab, University of Milan** (June 4, 2025). The workshop introduces students to geospatial data processing and visualization techniques in `Python`, combining structured data, text analysis, and interactive mapping.

## 📦 Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TopicModel_Visualizing.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook for the full hands-on session. Covers geospatial data, topic modeling with BERT, and interactive map generation. |
| `LanguageDetection_Translation.ipynb` | Preprocessing pipeline: detects review language, translates non-English content using Google Translate API. |
| `css-python-geo.yml` | Conda environment file. Reproduces the working environment for the workshop. |

> **Note**: Please download all necessary data files from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) — including listings, reviews, and neighborhood GeoJSON files for Milan — and place them under a local `data/` directory. Also, make sure to include `preprocessed_comment_data.csv`,  which is generated after running `LanguageDetection_Translation.ipynb.`
